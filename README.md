# Data Analysis with SQL

## Overview

This repository provides resources and examples for performing data analysis using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful tool for querying and managing data stored in relational databases. This guide will help you understand the basics of SQL, common data analysis techniques, and how to apply them to real-world datasets.

In this repository we will see:

## Basic SQL Concepts

- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieve data from a database.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filter records based on specific conditions.
- **JOINs**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- **GROUP BY**: Aggregate data based on one or more columns.
- **ORDER BY**: Sort the result set based on one or more columns.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Perform calculations on data (e.g., COUNT, AVG, SUM).

## Data Analysis Techniques

- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarizing data to understand its main characteristics.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing different datasets or groups within a dataset.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying patterns or trends over time.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Using historical data to predict future outcomes (note: SQL alone may not cover advanced predictive analytics).
